## About Me
Hello! I'm Valerie, a first-year Systems and Synthetic Biology major. I have some prior experience with coding, mostly in Python, but I'm completely new to R. I'm excited to get more familiarity with this language and gain experience in creating more complex programs. BIS15L seems like a really cool way to learn more about programming in a biology context, and to gain practical skills that will help me with future bioinformatics projects.

### Homework
My homeworks are now all in a folder called "homework". A few of them I forgot to knit until 2/20 class when I reorganized all of them, so I hope you'll be understanding about that!
