## Instructions
This homework is a bit less traditional this week. There are some errors in the code below. In addition add notes and titles to the code chunks that explains what the code chunk does. Use AI tools, notes from class, or any other resources to help fix the errors. Feel free to edit any plots to your preference. Don't forget to answer the two questions at the bottom. Upon completion, you should not have to '#' out any of the code chunks.

Push your final work to your repository. Your final lab report should be organized, clean, and run free from errors. Remember, you must remove the `#` for the included code chunks to run. Be sure to add your name to the author header above.   

Again make sure to use the formatting conventions of RMarkdown to make your report neat and clean!  

Load the libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)
```


1. Read the csv file for the data set into an object.
```{r}
blood_count <- read_csv("data/blood_count_dataset.csv")
blood_count <- clean_names(blood_count)
```

2. Take a look at the structure of the data set.
```{r}
glimpse(blood_count)
```

3. Provide the min, max, and mean red blood cell counts grouped by gender.
```{r}
blood_count %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarize(min=min(red_blood_cells),
            mean=mean(red_blood_cells),
            max=max(red_blood_cells))
```


4. Filtering for male patients only, provide the mean of every numerical column.
```{r}
options(scipen = 999, digits = 2)

blood_count %>% 
  filter(gender == "Male") %>%
  select(3:9) %>%
  colMeans(na.rm = TRUE)

```

5. Now do the same for female patients only. 
```{r}
blood_count %>% 
  filter(gender == "Female") %>%
  select(3:9) %>%
  colMeans(na.rm = T)
```


6. Create boxplots of all the blood count tests grouped by gender.
```{r}
blood_count %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 3:9, names_to = "test", values_to = "values") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = values, fill = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~test, scales = "free")+
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Blood Count Tests",
       x = "Test",
       y = "Values")

```

7. Create a new dataframe object including "age_group" as a categorical variable based on "age" 
```{r}
grouped_bc <- blood_count %>%
  mutate(age_group = case_when(
    age >= 20 & age <= 29 ~ "20s",
    age >= 30 & age <= 39 ~ "30s",
    age >= 40 & age <= 49 ~ "40s",
    age >= 50 & age <= 59 ~ "50s",
    age >= 60 & age <= 70 ~ "60+")) # there were only 4 people in 70s, so I combined it with 60s

head(grouped_bc)

```

8. Create boxplots of all the blood count tests grouped by age group.
```{r}
grouped_bc %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 3:9, names_to = "test", values_to = "values") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age_group, y = values, fill = age_group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~test, scales = "free") +  # Facet by the "Test" variable
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Blood Count Tests by Age Group",
       x = "Age Group",
       y = "Values")

```
9. What are two drawbacks and two benefits of AI?

Some drawbacks: AI will often give inaccurate code and make mistakes, so relying on it unquestioningly will often end you up with mistakes you don't know how to fix or code that is simply not right for the situation. It also doesn't necessarily know how you like to code as well as you know how you like. Additionally, over-reliance on AI tools to write code can inhibit creativity when attempting to come up with your own code because you're only thinking within the functions it gives you.

Some benefits: AI can help get the framework of code written out, saving you time. It can also teach you about new functions you hadn't heard about before when you ask it how to do something.

10. Do you think you will use AI for coding in the future? Why or why not?

Oh I absolutely will, and already have for some R personal projects. The benefits I listed above are significant, and the drawbacks can be either worked around or prevented by simply not overusing AI.


## Push your final code to GitHub!
Please be sure that you check the `keep md` file in the knit preferences.
